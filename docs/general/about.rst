About WYMeditor
===============

WYMeditor is an open source web-based WYSIWYM editor with semantics and
standards in mind. The WYM-part stands for "What You Mean" compared to the more
common "What You See Is What You Get".

WYMeditor's main concept is to leave details of the document's visual layout,
and to concentrate on its structure and meaning, while trying to give the user
as much comfort as possible (at least as WYSIWYG editors).

WYMeditor has been created to generate perfectly structured XHTML strict code,
to conform to the W3C specifications and to facilitate further processing by
modern applications.

With WYMeditor, the code can't be contaminated by visual informations like font
styles and weights, borders, colors, ... The end-user defines content meaning,
which will determine its aspect by the use of style sheets. The result is easy
and quick maintenance of information.

As the code is compliant to W3C specifications, you can for example process it
using a XSLT (at the client or the server side), giving you a wide range of
applications.

Why WYMeditor?
--------------

WYMeditor is different from the `traditional <http://www.tinymce.com/>`_
`editors <http://ckeditor.com/>`_ because we are 100% focused on providing a
simple experience for users that separates the content of their document from
the presentation of that document.  We focus on enforcing web standards and
separating a document's structure (HTML) from its presentation (CSS). Your
users won't know and shouldn't care about HTML, but when they need consistent,
standards-compliant, clean content, they'll thank you.

There are lots of choices when it comes to a brower-based editor and many of
them are stable, mature projects with thousands of users. If you need an editor
that gives total control and flexibility to the user (not you, the developer),
then WYMeditor is probably not for you. If you want an editor that you can
customize to provide the specific capabilities your users need, and you want
users focused on the structure of their content instead of tweaking fonts and
margins, you should give WYMeditor a try.

We also fully support Internet Explorer 6, for those poor souls who have no
choice.
