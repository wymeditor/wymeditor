Welcome to WYMeditor's documentation!
#####################################

WYMeditor is an open source,
web-based WYSIWYM editor
that allows non-technical users
to create clean,
semantic,
standards-compliant HTML.
The WYM-part stands for "What You Mean"
compared to the more common "What You See Is What You Get".

**************
Why WYMeditor?
**************

WYMeditor is different from the `traditional <http://www.tinymce.com/>`_
`editors <http://ckeditor.com/>`_
because we are 100% focused
on providing a simple experience for users
that separates the content of their document
from the presentation of that document.
We focus on enforcing web standards
and separating a document's structure (HTML)
from its presentation (CSS).
Your users won't know
and shouldn't care about HTML,
but when they need consistent,
standards-compliant,
clean content,
they'll thank you.

There are lots of choices when it comes to a browser-based editor
and many of them are stable, mature projects with thousands of users.
If you need an editor that gives total control and flexibility to the user
(not you, the developer),
then WYMeditor is probably not for you.
If you want an editor that you can customize
to provide the specific capabilities your users need,
and you want users focused on the structure of their content
instead of tweaking fonts and margins,
you should give WYMeditor a try.
