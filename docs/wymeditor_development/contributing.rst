We <3 Contributions
-------------------

We love your contributions. Anything, whitespace cleanup, spelling corrections,
translations, jslint cleanup, etc is very welcome.

The general idea is that you fork WYMeditor, make your changes in a branch, add
appropriate unit tests, hack until you're done, make sure the tests still pass,
and then send a pull request. If you have questions on how to do any of this,
please stop by #wymeditor on freenode IRC and ask. We're happy to help!

Example Process
---------------

#. Fork `wymeditor <https://github.com/wymeditor/wymeditor>`_ to your personal
   GitHub account.

#. Clone it (``git clone <your personal repo url>``) and add the official repo
   as a remote so that you easily can keep up new changes (``git remote add
   upstream https://github.com/wymeditor/wymeditor.git``).

#. Create a new branch and check it out (``git checkout -b
   my-cool-new-feature``).

#. Make your changes, making sure to follow the
   :doc:`/wymeditor_development/coding_standard`. If possible, also include a unit test in
   src/test/unit/test.js.

#. Add the changed files to your staging area (``git add <modified files>``)
   and commit your changes with a meaningful message (``git commit -m "Describe
   your changes"``). Make sure and follow the
   :doc:`/wymeditor_development/coding_standard`.

#. Repeat steps 4-5 until you're done.

#. Add yourself to the AUTHORS file!

#. Make sure unit tests pass in as many browsers as you can. If you don't have
   access to some of the supported browsers, be sure and note that in your pull
   request message so we can test them.

#. Make sure your code is up to date (see below) and if everything is fine push
   your changes to GitHub (``git push origin <your branch>``) and send a *Pull
   Request*.

Staying up to Date
------------------

If your fork or local branch falls behind the official upstream repository
please do a ``git fetch`` and then ``merge`` or ``rebase`` to make sure your
changes will apply cleanly â€“ otherwise your pull request will not be accepted.

See the `GitHub help section <http://help.github.com/>`_ for further details.
