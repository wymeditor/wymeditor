Structured Headings
===================

This plugin modifies the styling and function of headings in the editor to make
them easier to use to structure documents. Currently in development.

Features
--------

* Automatic numbering of headings to better outline a document.
* More features to come on further development.

Applying Structured Headings Styling outside of the Editor
----------------------------------------------------------

The numbering added to headings in the editor is not parsed with the content of
the document, but rather, it is added as styling using CSS in IE8+, Chrome, and
Firefox, or it is added as separate content using a stand-alone JavaScript
function with additional CSS styling in IE7.

To apply the heading numbering to a document outside of the editor, follow
these steps:

#. Get the CSS for the structured headings. If you are using IE8+, Chrome,
   or Firefox, enter the ``WYMeditor.printStructuredHeadingsCSS()``
   command in the browser console on the page of the editor using the
   structured headings plugin to print the CSS to the console. If you are using
   IE7, it uses different CSS than the other browsers, and you can get this CSS
   from its stylesheet ``structured_headings_ie7_user.css`` available in the
   plugin's directory.
#. Either copy this CSS to an existing stylesheet or make a new stylesheet with
   this CSS.
#. Apply the stylesheet with the CSS to all of the pages that contain documents
   that had heading numbering added to them in the editor.
#. If you are using IE7, in addition to the previous steps, add the script
   ``jquery.wymeditor.structured_headings.js`` available in the plugin's
   directory to all of the pages that contain documents that had heading
   numbering added to them in the editor. This script provides the function
   ``numberHeadingsIE7()`` which detects which headings on the page were
   assigned numbering in WYMeditor and adds the numbering for these headings
   into the page. This function should be called in a script on document ready
   after the ``jquery.wymeditor.structured_headings.js`` script is included on
   the page. Here is an example of what that script should look like:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        jQuery(document).ready(function() { numberHeadingsIE7(); });

Browser Support
---------------

The plugin supports IE7+, Chrome, and Firefox, but it works less conveniently
in IE7 as you can see by the additional steps it requires for implementation in
that browser.
